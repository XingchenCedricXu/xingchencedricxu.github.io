I am a first year PhD student at Michael G. Foster School of Bussiness, University of Washington.

My current research focuses on the design and evaluation of IT-enabled interventions, which can be further divided into two lines: On one hand, I am interested in how market designs or peers' behavior intervene users’ decision-making process and thereby affect economic value and social welfare. On the other hand, I am also interested in robust statistical methods to evaluate treatment effect dynamics and further optimize policies. My research topics are quite broad, including Fintech, Online Dating/Matching, Online Healthcare, Video/Live Streaming, etc. Methodologically, I leverage econometrics, randomized field experiments, and machine learning/deep learning to analyze data and infer causality.

Before my PhD career, I studied Information Management and Information Systems at School of Economics and Mangament, Tsinghua University.
