I am a final year undergraduate at School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University. I major in Information Management and Information Systems. 

My current research focuses on the design and evaluation of IT-enabled interventions, which can be divided into three subcategories. First of all, I am interested in how market designs that incorporating social norms or economic incentives intervene users’ decision-making process and further impact market efficiency. Secondly, I want to examine how users’ interaction with AI-based systems affect users’ behavior so that the amount or distribution of economic and social welfare is further influenced. The third is to instill psychological and economic factors into algorithms, especially recommendation algorithms, for long term success.

I am fortunate to conduct research under the supervision of Professor Kevin Hong (UH Bauer) and Professor Nina Huang (UH Bauer). I am also glad to work with Professor De Liu (UMN Carlson), Professor Gordon Burtch (UMN Carlson), and Dr. Yumei He (UH Bauer). Outside of academia, I’ve been working with an online dating company and an online education company as an external researcher.
