I am a Ph.D. student in Information Systems at the Michael G. Foster School of Business, University of Washington. I'm fortunate to work under the supervision of Professor [Yong Tan](http://faculty.washington.edu/ytan/index.htm). Before my Ph.D. career, I studied Information Management and Information Systems at the School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University.

I am greatly interested in the economics of Transformative AI, with research focusing on AI’s impact on labor markets and the adoption barriers faced by enterprises and individuals. I also study the complex dynamics of AI-AI interaction that emerge when multiple participants deploy AI within a market.

I employ a multidisciplinary approach that combines econometric methods (including structural estimation), field/laboratory experiments, analytical models, and machine learning algorithms (including reinforcement learning and large language models) to analyze data, infer causality, and optimize policies. My work has appeared in *Management Science* and *Information Systems Research*, and has received paper awards from INFORMS, WITS, ICIS, and DSI.

Over the past several years, I have collaborated closely with industry leaders to develop, implement, and evaluate large language models across exciting, high-stakes business environments. I have also partnered with multiple platforms to address their pain points by combining their business intuition with our rigorous "model thinking". Additionally, leveraging unique, fine-grained data from these collaborations, I conduct empirical research to understand user behavior patterns and inform corresponding adjustments to platform policies and algorithms; several of these changes have persisted in production and continue to deliver substantial business value.

I believe in diving deep into data and models, ensuring every project receives detailed attention. To maintain this standard, I must strictly limit the number of new collaborations I initiate each year. For future projects, I prioritize those that meet three criteria: alignment with the topics mentioned above, relevance to important sectors, and the presence of unique data/methodological challenges. Although full-scale collaboration requires a high level of mutual commitment, I am always open to casual chats to exchange perspectives.
