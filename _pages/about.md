I am a first year PhD student at Michael G. Foster School of Bussiness, University of Washington. I'm fortunate to work under the supervision of Professor [Yong Tan](http://faculty.washington.edu/ytan/index.htm).

My current research focuses on the design and evaluation of IT-enabled interventions, which can be further divided into two lines: On one hand, I am interested in how market designs/peers' behavior intervene users’ decision-making process and thereby affect economic value/social welfare. On the other hand, I am also interested in improving statistical methods to evaluate treatment effect dynamics and further optimize policies. My research topics are quite broad, including Fintech, Online Dating/Matching, Online Healthcare, Live Streaming/Video, etc. Methodologically, I leverage econometric/statistical models, analytical models, randomized field experiments, and machine learning/deep learning to conduct design, analyze data, and infer causality.

Before my PhD career, I studied Information Management and Information Systems at School of Economics and Mangament, Tsinghua University. I was glad to cultivate research skills under the guidance of Professor [Kevin Hong](http://kevinhong.me/) and Professor [Bo Li](http://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/libo) during that period.
