I am a final year undergraduate at School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University.

My current research focuses on the design and evaluation of IT-enabled interventions, which can be further divided into two lines. First of all, I am interested in how market designs that incorporate social norms or economic incentives intervene users’ decision-making process and further impact market efficiency. Secondly, I want to examine how users’ interaction with systems affect users’ behavior so that the amount or distribution of economic and social welfare is further influenced.
