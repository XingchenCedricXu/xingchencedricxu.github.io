I am a first year PhD student at Michael G. Foster School of Bussiness, University of Washington. I'm fortunate to work under the supervision of Professor [Yong Tan](http://faculty.washington.edu/ytan/index.htm).

My current research focuses on the design and evaluation of IT-enabled interventions, which can be further divided into two lines: On one hand, I am interested in how AI systems/market design/peers' behavior affect users’ decision-making process and thereby influence economic value/social welfare. On the other hand, I am also interested in designing econometric and statistical models to undercover mechanisms and further optimize policies. My research topics are quite broad, including Fintech, Social Media, Online Matching, Online Healthcare, Video Game, etc. Methodologically, I leverage econometric/statistical models (including structural models), analytical models, field/lab experiments, machine learning/deep learning to conduct design, analyze data, and infer causality.

Before my PhD career, I studied Information Management and Information Systems at School of Economics and Mangament, Tsinghua University. I was glad to cultivate research skills under the guidance of Professor [Kevin Hong](http://kevinhong.me/) and Professor [Bo Li](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1233/6986.htm) during that period.
