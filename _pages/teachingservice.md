## For Pre-doctoral Students
I am thrilled to work with individuals from diverse backgrounds and it would be my honor to assist you with your graduate program applications, particularly Ph.D. programs. I also believe that motivation and a shared commitment to hard work are essential.

To ensure that each project receives the proper attention and focus, I limit the number of pre-doctoral students I work with to a maximum of two at any given time. This approach allows us to explore interesting projects and enhance our research skills in a collaborative environment.

I kindly encourage you to take the time to reflect on your decision, and I would like to assure you that your background should not be a hindrance, as motivation and dedication are key factors in cultivating any skill.

## Teaching and Mentoring Philosophy from Herbert A. Simon
*1. "Teaching is not entertainment, but it is unlikely to be successful unless it is entertaining (the more respectable word is interesting.)"*

*2(a). "I advise my graduate students to pick a research problem that is important (so that it will matter if it is solved), but one for which they have a secret weapon that gives some prospect of success."*

*2(b). "One of the first rules of science is if somebody delivers a secret weapon to you, you better use it."*
