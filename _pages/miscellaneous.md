## Hobby
In my spare time, I enjoy coding, reading, and watching TV series.

-	I have a special interest in popular science books, such as *Poor Economics*, *Nudge*, *Freakonomics*, *Who Gets What--and why*, *Thinking, Fast and Slow*……
-	I am especially interested in TV series related to Finance ([*Billions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_(TV_series))), Science ([*The Big Bang Theory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory)), Technology ([*Silicon Valley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series))), and Politics ([*Yes, Minister*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister)).
