In my spare time, I enjoy coding, reading, and watching TV series. 
-	I am currently trying to generalize some causal inference packages to more complex empirical contexts.
-	Inspired from the book [*Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice:_What%27s_the_Right_Thing_to_Do%3F), I strive to improve my ability of critical thinking based on a wide range of philosophical theories.
-	I am especially interested in TV series related to Finance ([*Billions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_(TV_series))), Science ([*The Big Bang Theory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory)), Technology ([*Silicon Valley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series))), and Politics ([*Yes, Minister*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister)).

If you find any interesting coding project, books, or TV series, please contact me!

Furthermore, with the expectation that I might lose most of my hair during the Ph.D. career, I keep a collection of personal photography (The photo shown below includes the 23-year-old version of me). Letâ€™s check what will happen to me in the next five years.
