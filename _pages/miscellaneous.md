## Hobby
I feel excited about what I am doing every day! In my spare time, I also enjoy coding (checking repositories with elegant codes), reading, trading, and watching TV series. 
-	I am an enthusiastic coder. I use Fortran, Java, C(C++, C#), Python, Ruby, Julia, R, Stan, Matlab, JavaScript, Stata, Bash, SPSS, SmartPLS, SQL... It's amazing to observe that AI has the ability to handle some of my routine coding tasks.
- I enjoy reading various genres, including philosophy, economics, physics/complexity, biography, and sci-fi. Someday, I hope to write books that appeal to both academic and general readers. My favorite book is [*The Three-body Problem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three-Body_Problem_(novel))!
-	I consider myself an engaged participant in trading. The financial market not only reflects the mathematical beauty ingrained in its structure but also captures the intricate nuances of human behavior through its ever-shifting dynamics. I am sincerely appreciative of my friends who introduced me to this field, as it has been instrumental in my personal growth and resilience. If I may offer a suggestion, I would highly recommend delving into the book [*Reminiscences of a Stock Operator*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reminiscences_of_a_Stock_Operator), after gaining some experience in trading.
-	I'm also an explorer of loyalty programs related to credit cards, hotels, and airlines. My interest lies in crafting consumer strategies (e.g., maximize signup bonus by optimizing the credit cards' application sequence), as this endeavor necessitates comprehending the intermediaries' competitions and the revenue-sharing structures before implementing forward-looking optimization (forums in [*Chinese*](https://www.uscardforum.com/) or [*English*](https://www.flyertalk.com/)).
-	I am especially interested in TV series related to finance ([*Billions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_(TV_series))), science ([*The Big Bang Theory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory)), technology ([*Silicon Valley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series))), politics ([*Yes, Minister*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister)), and healthcare ([*Dopesick*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopesick_(miniseries))).

## Sports
I'm a runner and a retired taekwondo athlete.
-	My Personal Best (PB) in 100m is 11.2s.
-	I won a silver medal (taekwondo: 53kg male) in a city-level professional sports meet.
-	I also finished a Road Cycling around Qinghai Lake (360 kilometers) in four days.
