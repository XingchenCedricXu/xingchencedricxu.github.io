## Hobby
In my spare time, I enjoy coding, reading, trading, and watching TV series. 
-	I am an enthusiastic coder. I use Fortran, Java, C(C++, C#), Python, Ruby, Julia, JavaScript, R, Stan, Stata, Bash, SPSS, SmartPLS, SQL... It's amazing to observe that AI has the ability to handle some of my routine coding tasks.
-	I love reading. I hope one day I can also write a popular science book like *Poor Economics*, *Nudge*, *Freakonomics*, *Who Gets What--and why*, *Thinking, Fast and Slow*…… My favorite book is *The Three-body problem*!
-	Trading captivates me as a reflection of human nature through market fluctuations.
-	I am especially interested in TV series related to finance ([*Billions*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billions_(TV_series))), science ([*The Big Bang Theory*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory)), technology ([*Silicon Valley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series))), politics ([*Yes, Minister*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_Minister)), and healthcare ([*Dopesick*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopesick_(miniseries))).

## Sports
I'm a runner and a retired taekwondo athlete.
-	My Personal Best (PB) in 100m is 11.2s.
-	I won a silver medal (taekwondo: 53kg male) in a city-level professional sports meet (one step away from Zhejiang Sports Team).
-	I also finished a Road Cycling around Qinghai Lake (360 kilometers) in four days.
